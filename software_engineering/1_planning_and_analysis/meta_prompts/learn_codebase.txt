Please analyze this code repository with a top-down, architecture-first approach.

Perform a comprehensive static analysis and provide your findings as a Markdown document in the following structure:

## 1. Executive Summary
- Primary purpose and domain
- Technology stack overview
- Key architectural patterns identified
- Critical findings summary

## 2. Architecture Overview
- System components and their relationships
- Create Mermaid diagrams for:
  - High-level component/system architecture
  - Key class relationships (if applicable)
  - Data flow diagrams
- Identify architectural patterns (MVC, microservices, design patterns, etc.)
- Identify whether there are any files and components that contain core mathemetical and statistical operations. If so record these in a table. If the operations are part of a known algorithm or method note this.

## 3. Dependency Analysis
- External dependencies (with versions from Poetry/UV configs)
- Dependency health and currency
- Potential version conflicts or concerns
- Internal module dependencies

## 4. Integration Points
- External APIs and services
- Database connections and schemas
- File system interactions
- Network communications
- Message queues or event systems

## 5. Development Workflow
- CI/CD pipeline analysis (from configs)
- Testing strategy and coverage
- Build and deployment processes
- Development environment setup (Vagrant, containers, etc.)

## 6. Code Quality Metrics
- Complexity analysis
- Adherence to Python/R/bash best practices
- Code organization and modularity
- Documentation completeness
- Design pattern usage

## 7. Security Assessment
- Potential vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data handling
- Authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## 8. Troubleshooting Guide
- Logging mechanisms and locations
- Common error patterns
- Debug entry points
- Monitoring and observability features

For each section, provide specific file references and line numbers where applicable. Generate all diagrams in Mermaid syntax embedded in the Markdown and export the document to a Markdown file titled "architecture_overview.md". If this file currently exists, do not replace it. Instead ask me for a different filename. Ask me questions one at a time if you need additional clarification.
