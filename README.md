# AI & LLM Resources Repository

This repository is an organized collection of AI and Large Language Model (LLM) resources for tasks in the research software engineering, data engineering, data science, and computational biology domains that can benefit from AI-augmentation. Resources are categorized by technical function and organized into reusable meta-prompts and workflows (chains-of-prompts).

## Directory Descriptions

### `learning`
Resources for structured learning processes across technical domains. Organized by learning workflow stages to support systematic knowledge acquisition and skill development.

- **1_research**: Information gathering, literature identification, and initial exploration of topics
- **2_summarize**: Condensing and organizing gathered information into coherent summaries
- **3_brainstorm**: Generating ideas, exploring possibilities, and creative problem-solving
- **4_plan**: Developing structured approaches and implementation strategies

### `software_engineering`
Resources roughly organized by Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages.

- **1_planning_and_analysis**: Requirements gathering, feasibility analysis, and project planning
- **2_design**: System architecture, API design, database schema, and technical specifications
- **3_coding**: Implementation, code generation, refactoring, and development best practices
- **4_testing**: Unit testing, integration testing, test automation, and quality assurance
- **5_deployment**: CI/CD, containerization, infrastructure as code, and release management
- **6_maintenance**: Bug fixes, performance optimization, monitoring, and technical debt management

### `data_processing`
Resources for data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), data pipeline development, and data quality management across various data sources and formats.

### `statistical_analysis`
Resources for statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, experimental design, and statistical inference using both classical and modern statistical methods.

### `machine_learning`
Resources for ML model development, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and deployment of machine learning systems.

### `documentation`
Resources for creating technical documentation, user guides, API documentation, code comments, and knowledge management systems.

### `reporting_and_visualization`
Resources for creating data visualizations, generating reports, dashboard development, and communicating analytical results to stakeholders.

### `career_development`
Resources for professional growth and goal setting.

## Resource Types

### `meta_prompts`
Reusable prompt templates that proceed the context for a specific use case. Provides clarity to LLM models to follow a step-by-step process to accomplish a task or achieve a result.

### `workflows`
Chain prompting sequences that combine multiple prompts to solve complex, multi-step problems.
